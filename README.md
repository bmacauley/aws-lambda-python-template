# AWS Lambda Template

This is a template project for writing a lambda

## Getting Started
First install the requirements for the project using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The tests can now be run with:

```
make test
```

## Motivation

As I have started using aws lambdas much more frequently, I have found them to be an excellent way of running simple 
deployment, maintenance, monitoring, and testing tasks. However, the initial development setup was a bit tedious to 
get off the ground. So I created this project.
